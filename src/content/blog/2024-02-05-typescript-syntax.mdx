This is that one little syntax hill that I will forever defend. The shorthand syntax for Arrays in TypeScript is unnecessary and unclear.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
```ts title="Proper Array syntax is good"
Array<T>
```

```ts title="Shorthand Array syntax is bad"
T[]
```

</div>

## Why you should use the Array type

- Immediately clear when reading left-to-right that the type is an `Array`.

  ```ts
  type MyStuff = Array<{ some: BigObject }>;
  ```

- Matches the syntax for `Set<T>` and `Map<K, V>`

  ```ts
  type MyArr = Array<T>;
  type MySet = Set<T>;
  type MyMap = Map<K, V>;
  ```

## Why you should not use Array shorthand

- Easily overused on complex types

  ```ts
  type MyStuff = { some: BigObject }[];
  ```

  You're probably going to argue that `{ some: BigObject }` should be further extracted out, and you're right, but remember that people are inherently lazy and won't always do that.

- Easily mistaken between tuple types, but they are not identical:

  ```ts
  [string] !== string[]
  ```

## Automate the good syntax

Arguably, it's hard to enforce a single way when two different syntaxes have the exact same meaning. Luckily, there's an auto-fixing ESLint rule for that: Use [`@typescript-eslint/array-type`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/array-type/#generic) set to `"generic"`:

```js title=".eslintrc.cjs"
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    '@typescript-eslint/array-type': ['error', { default: 'generic', readonly: 'generic' }],
  },
};
```

Previously in this series, we [introduced the reasoning and requirements](/blog/2022/06/04/custom-wedding-website/) and [chose tools that we will use to build](/blog/2022/06/04/custom-wedding-website-part-1/) our custom wedding website.

## Setting up Firebase

Setting up a Firebase project was _actually_ a delightful experience.

First, create the project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/). This step just takes a couple clicks.

After creating the project in the Firebase console, you need to hook something up to actually deploy and work with configurations from the command-line.

If you don't have it already, install `firebase-tools` and log into the commandline interface:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```

Once installed, we can log into firebase and initialize the database. Run the following command, select your project, and customize as you want. I didn't change any of the defaults to get started.

```bash
firebase init firestore
```

Next, we are going to want hosting, because it's free. Again, run the init and walk through the wizard.

```bash
firebase init hosting
```

From there, the initialization script actually walked through a few questions which didn't seem patronizing for a _wizard_. Then it noticed that the origin for my git repo pointed to Github, so it asked if I wanted to set up automated Github actions to deploy on merge to `main` and stage deploys for PRs. _Heck yes!_

## Parcel dev environment & bundling

Let me get one thing straight: using Parcel was the absolute most straightforward and easy dev/build framework that I've ever picked up. I don't know that I needed to do anything more than point it at a root `index.html` file – and that was really it!

```bash npm2yarn
yarn add preact preact-router
yarn add --dev autoprefixer parcel postcss tailwindcss
```

<Aside type="danger" title="Typescript">

I used Typescript, but you really don't have to. In fact, I didn't require that static types were correct at all. It was mostly just a helper to have automcomplete for working with Firebase. From here on out, I'll actually just strip all the types out and use `.js` & `.jsx` instead of `.ts` & `.tsx`.

</Aside>

Next we need some basic setup for Parcel, Preact, and Tailwind. Create the following files following this structure, with copypasta contents to follow:

```
wedding-app/
├─ src/
│  ├─ index.html
│  ├─ index.css
│  └─ index.jsx
├─ package.json
└─ tailwind.config.js
```

<code>src/index.html</code> This will be the main entrypoint for Parcel to run its development server and build for production.

```html title="src/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Kelly & Paul’s wedding</title>

    // Parcel will pick up references to CSS files and compile them as necessary // This makes Tailwind setup in the
    next step a breeze
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    // This will be the root element that we use for the Preact application
    <div id="root"></div>
    // Parcel will pick up references to JavaScript files (or Typescript) and compile them
    <script type="module" src="./index.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

`./src/index.jsx`

```tsx title="src/index.jsx"
import { h, render } from 'preact';
import { App } from './App';

const root = document.getElementById('root');
render(<App />, root!);
```

## Tailwind CSS

If you prefer a more in-depth setup, checkout [Tailwindcss‘s installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

`./src/index.css`

```css title="src/index.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

`./tailwind.config.js`

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,ts,tsx}'],
};
```

`./postcssrc.json` One little gotcha here: don't forget to add a Postcss configuration for Parcel to pick up so that it knows it should be using Tailwind!

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "tailwindcss": {}
  }
}
```

## That's all!

`./package.json` We just need a couple quick scripts in our root package configuration in order to run the Parcel dev server and build for production

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "wedding-app",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel src/index.html",
    "build": "rm -rf dist && NODE_ENV=production parcel build ./src/*.html --public-url /"
  }
}
```

Honestly, this was kind of everything that I needed to get started. I know this is a little nitty gritty into some weird details, but hopefully helpful for someone (or myself) down the line.

From here, we can run `yarn start` and see our application running in the browser immediately.

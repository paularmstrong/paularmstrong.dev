## Saving common web apps

One issue that I have with web apps is that I often want the app isolated so that it's easy to get to via <kbd title="Command + Tab">⌘ + ↹</kbd> and it can be relegated to its own space/desktop.

Initially, saving PWAs as desktop "applications" was a great start, but they have a lot of downsides:

1. Chrome only. If you want to use another browser (like Firefox, Arc, or Safari),
1. Any link you open from inside the PWA will always open in Chrome. Even with [system-level url redirection](#url-handling).
1. Chrome must be open when any one of the PWAs you've got are open.

## Browser

At this point, I've tried to make every browser my default (except Edge… that one can just stop).

## URL handling

- [Arc Air Traffic Control](https://resources.arc.net/en/articles/7670020-air-traffic-control-route-links-to-the-right-space-automatically)

## Keeping the Dock clean

Here's a neat trick: you can add invisible spacers to your OS X Dock to help organize apps for various purposes.

```sh caption="Add a single spacer tile to your Dock"
defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}';
# repeat above for the number of spacers you need
killall Dock;
```

I keep applications in my Dock separated by purpose:

1. Home/personal & browser
1. Work apps
1. Development

<div class="lg:bustout">
  <Image
    src={DockImage}
    alt="A screenshot of a Mac OS X Dock featuring spacer tiles with icons, left to right: (spacer) Plexamp, Home Assistant, Mail, iMessage, Arc Browser, (spacer), GMail, Google Calendar, Google Meet, Slack, (spacer), iTerm 2, VSCode, (spacer), followed by folders for Downloads and Trash"
  />

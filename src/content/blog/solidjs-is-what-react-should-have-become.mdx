## The good

I _want_ to say _great_, but I'm still early into this journey of working with Solid, so I don't want to put my horses before the cartâ€¦

### Speed

I am continually blown away by how much faster rendering updates are in Solid. This is by design, since Solid is directly updating DOM nodes and not using an intermediary virtual DOM with diffing like React and others. But stillâ€¦ it's amazing.

I am converting an older project from React 18 to Solid and hovers with tooltips moving and updating are over 10x faster in Solid than in React. 30 or more milliseconds down to 3 milliseconds. The updates are faster than my eyes can track.

### Clear lifecycles

Early React with class components made sense. They had a very clear rendering flow and lifecycle. It was obvious when a component would update and really easy to opt-out using the method `shouldComponentUpdate()`. Now with functional components and hooks all of this is less clear. So much less clear that it seems one of the core team will tell you something different every month.

Solid makes sense. Component functions are called only when they need to be because something changed. That's it.

But on top of that, Solid has explicit lifecycle methods:

- [`onMount`](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#onmount): Runs on the first time a component is rendered.
- [`onCleanup`](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#oncleanup): Runs when the component will be destroyed.

That's it. No special things like: "if you return this function from this special hook", "provide a special empty array to this hook", or "sometimes it dependsâ€¦".

### `useâ€¦` vs `createâ€¦` methods

I quickly noticed a confusion point when amoving from React to Solid. Some things that I thought were like "hooks" in Solid start with the `create` prefix instead of `use`. Most notably, instead of `useEffect`, we have `createEffect`.

The reason for this is all part of the clarity of Solid: `create` functions run once and only once. You're _creating_ something. So, when I have a component, and inside of it I have something that defines a side-effect, I'm only ever _defining_ that side effect once.

But it's also necessary to understand that what happens _inside_ of that effect is dependent upon the reactive signals that are used inside.

{/* TODO: maybe replace this with something that could be problematic in react, like updating a parent context in a loop? */}

```ts
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

createEffect(() => {
  if (count < 4) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCount((current) => current + 1);
    }, 1000);
  }
});
```

### Data fetching

I've seen a good amount of divisiveness in the React community around how to do data fetching. Not just with what tool to use, but _how_ it should be done with respect to React and its rendering cycles. The React docs show you how to [fetch data with `useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#fetching-data-with-effects), but the core team also is trying to make you completely avoid it by picking and using a third-party framework first instead of writing data fetching hooks yourself.

> The goal we have is to drive useEffect usage to as close to zero as possible, not necessarily to make it more intuitive (though we have ideas there, too).

But what if you have other needs or don't want to use one one of the two very different frameworks available? Now you're left to figure it all out on your own â€“ write an entire framework as well or just completely give up and use Next.js.

Solid's `createResource` (combined with the Solid Router below) is exactly what I expect at the framework level for integrating data fetching. It's simple, encourages using default browser APIs, and works out of the box.

<Aside type="tip" title="Solid Start, Router & the future">

Solid Start with `@solidjs/router` takes `createResource` a step fourther and introduces a potential future replacement method: `createAsync`. This is similar to `createResource`, but enable caching for you, without needing _yet another_ library like Tanstack Query.

### First party router

[Solid Router](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-router/getting-started/defining-routes) is the official routing solution for use with Solid. Presumably this means no more full-API-level breaking changes every few years on the core flow of a web application, and it works exactly like you'd expect a router to.

To top it off, [load functions](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-router/reference/load-functions/load) create a straightforward way to define data needed for a route that can be loaded up front before finishing a transition from one route to another.

```tsx title="./app.tsx"
import { lazy } from 'solid-js';
import { Route } from '@solidjs/router';
const User = lazy(() => import('./pages/users/[userId].ts'));

function fetchUser(userId: string) {
  // returns a Promise that resolves a User
}

// Data function
function fetchUserData({ params }: RouteDataFuncArgs) {
  const [user] = createResource(() => params.userId, fetchUser); // ðŸ‘ˆ Pass the id parameter to the fetchUser function
  return user;
}

// Pass it in the route definition
<Route path="/users/:id" component={User} data={fetchUserData} />;
```

Then it's all batteries included! Your route data is then directly available in the props passed to the Routeâ€™s component:

```tsx title="./pages/users/[userId].tsx"
export function User(props) {
  return <h1>props.user.name</h1>;
}
```

## The oddities

There seem to be two API reference sites: [solidjs.com/docs](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api) and [docs.solidjs.com](https://docs.solidjs.com/references). Each site has slightly more or less information than the other and I find myself needing to reference both at all times.

### Avoid destructuring

Most objects passed around in Solid, particularly component props, are [`Proxy` objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). Accessing a property on a reactive Proxy object typically triggers an update. You need to be careful when and where you grab individual properties off of objects.

<div class="lg:bustout">
<div class="gap-8 no-bustout lg:grid lg:grid-cols-2">

```tsx title="UserAvatar.react.tsx" caption="Typical pattern of prop destructuring in React."
function UserAvatar({ name, src }: Props) {
  return <img src={src} alt={name} />;
}
```

```tsx title="UserAvatar.solid.tsx" caption="Do not destructure props in Solid."
function UserAvatar(props: Props) {
  return <img src={props.src} alt={props.name} />;
}
```

</div>
</div>

### Control Flow

To properly and performantly handle reactive rendering, Solid requires you use [control flow components](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#control-flow). These feel odd at first, but I've gotten used to them pretty quickly:

- Using `<For>` instead of `Array.map()` to render lists of items.
- `<Switch>` and `<Match>` for mutually exclusive rendering conditions. Although arguably more flexible and easy to follow than chains of `if-else-if-elseâ€¦` in return renders.
- `<Show when={shouldShow}>` instead of ternaries: `{shouldShow ? <Component /> : null}`

## The bad(?)

I actually look at this section as more of positivesâ€¦ for some people these may be bad, but I am embracing the shift that these require:

- Lack of community modules
  - On the other hand, React has _too many_ modules and there's a lot of encouragement to grab things off the shelf. This results in a lot of bloat, duplicate (sub) dependencies, maintenance overhead, etcâ€¦
- You need to pay more attention to what is reactive and how to reference it.
  - But then on the other hand, it's sort of like manual memory management. You are forced to become intimately familiar with how changes will affect the performance of your application.

title: Why Tailwindcss?
description: With countless solutions being promoted for writing CSS without needing to write CSS by hand (like CSS-in-JS libraries), why are so many people reaching for Tailwindcss now?

Because.

## Drawbacks of CSS-in-JS

- runtime overhead
- increased uncached bundle sizes
- inability to cache styles, even if unchanging
- too easy to duplicate large swaths of style declarations

## Common arguments

### All the classNames clutter up my JSX code!

Well yes, and no. Perhaps your `Button` implementation looks something like the following, with many more classNames inline:

```jsx
function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <div role="button" className="rounded px-4 py-2 bg-teal-700 text-white">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Is this visually _much_ different than using styled components?

```jsx
const StyledButton = styled.div`
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;
  background-color: --var(color-teal-700);
  color: --var(color-white);
`;

export function Button({ children }) {
  return <StyledButton role="button">{children}</StyledButton>;
}
```

All we have done between the previous Tailwindcss and Styled Component examples previously is moved _where_ the style information sits. We can easily make the argument that the Styled version is much more verbose.

Still don't like the classNames inline? We could move _where_ they're defined just as easily:

```jsx
const buttonClassNames = 'rounded px-4 py-2 bg-teal-700 text-white';

export function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <div role="button" className={buttonClassNames}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

There! now they're basically the same, but one is shorter than the other and has [added benefits](#benefits)

## Alternative approaches

### React Native for Web

styleq - React Native for Web is actually moving toward the ability to extract css at compile time. This is so far all theoretical.

TODO: links, theory, etc

### [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/)

This actually looks like what React Native for Web and styleq is promising, but ready to use now.

### [Linaria](https://linaria.dev/)

Generates a single className for each unique set of styles written. Continues to have the common pitfalls of too much duplications, one-offs

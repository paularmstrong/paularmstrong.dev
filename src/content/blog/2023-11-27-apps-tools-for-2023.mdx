Here's a little trend for 2023 that's going around: listing out the default apps (and tools!) that I've used in 2023. I enjoy this little go around, as I've been getting to discover new apps that I might want to try.

</Aside>

I also did [something similar](/blog/2022/10/18/current-tool-chest/) last year, but in a much more limited capacity.

- <span id="mail">📨 Mail client:</span>

  - Personal: [Apple Mail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mail/id1108187098) – I'm transitioning my personal life away from GMail and Google services. Who knows if Apple is actually _better_ from a privacy standpoint, but I already pay for iCloud and own my own domain. It has worked will for the past half of this year.
  - Work: [Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/about/), but [saved to the Dock](https://support.apple.com/en-us/104996) through Safari.

- 📮 Mail server: (see also [Mail client](#mail))

  - Personal: [iCloud Mail](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/mail-on-icloudcom-overview-mm6b1a17e3/icloud)
  - Work: [Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/about/)

- 📆 Calendar: (see also [Mail client](#mail))

  - Personal: Apple Calendar – fits with the whole _moving away from Google_ thing.
  - Work: Google Calendar – Again, I don't have a choice on this, but I _do_ have the app [saved to Dock](https://support.apple.com/en-us/104996)

- <span id="notes">📝 Notes:</span> [Notion](https://notion.so)

  I had a lot of hesitation with Notion until I was forced to use it through work. I would prefer an open source alternative, but none have as powerful of database features as Notion does and I'm making heavy use of them.

  I was previously trying to use [Nextcloud](#cloud-files) to handle notes and many other things, but the web UI is slow and painfully cumbersome.

- ✅ To-Do:

  - Personal: [Notion](#notion) – with heavy use of database tables and ability to cross-link items to other pages in Notion really helps me keep track of what I've got going on.
  - Open source: [GitHub issues](https://github.com/paularmstrong)
  - Work: [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) – I dislike this tool almost as much as JIRA. It gets too complicated as soon as managers, project managers, compliance, and legal start adding requirements.

- 📷 Photo Shooting: iPhone 13 Pro
- 🎨 Photo Editing: None
- <span id="cloud-files">📁 Cloud file storage:</span> [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)

  I keep this privately hosted. It's nice to know that my files are actually _my_ files. I also have quite a few local backups.

- 📖 RSS: [NextCloud News](https://github.com/nextcloud/news)
- 🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: [Apple Contacts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/contacts/id1069512615)
- <span id="browser">🌐 Browser:</span> [Arc](https://arc.net/gift/628133c8)
- 💬 Chat:

  - [Messages](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/messages/id1146560473) – SMS/texts and iMessage
  - [Slack](https://slack.com) – Both for work and the local BendJS meetup group.
  - [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) – Because privacy matters

- 🔖 Bookmarks: [Arc](#browser)
- 📑 Read It Later: [Arc](#browser), recently [Notion](#notes) [Web Clipper](https://www.notion.so/help/web-clipper)
- 📜 Word Processing: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Markdown, [Notion](#notes)
- 📈 Spreadsheets: If I really need to do some complex manipulation, Google Sheets, but I'm equally or more likely to write a script with Node.js and process JSON files.
- 📊 Presentations:

  - Personal: I haven't given any talks or presentations in a few years. I'd like to get back into it, but I haven't found the right fit.
  - Work: Google Sheets

- 🛒 Shopping Lists: [Notion](#notes)
- 🍴 Meal Planning: [Notion](#notes)
- 💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance: N/A (😬)
- 📰 News: RSS, Reddit, Mastodon
- 🎵 Music: [Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/)

  I have a very large library of music collected over more than two decades. I just can't let go of the super rare albums and EPs that will never be on any of the cloud services.

- 🎤 Podcasts: None. I can't pay attention to podcasts and do anything else at the same time.
- 🔐 Password Management: [1Password](https://1password.com/)
- 🧑‍💻 Code Editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  I reluctantly gave up trying to continue using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). It took me 4 tries over nearly as many months to get VSCode configured in a way that didn't feel overly intrusive. There are still a lot of quirks about it that I don't like, but being on the same editor as those I work with has been really helpful.

- ✈️ VPN: [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/)

## Bonus

- 🚀 Launcher: [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

  I bought a "Mega Supporter" Powerpack license years ago. I've had free upgrades for years and never a single complaint.

- 🎥 Screen recording: [Screenflick](https://www.araelium.com/screenflick-mac-screen-recorder)

- ☕️ No sleep: [KeepingYouAwake](https://keepingyouawake.app/)

  Don't tell your IT/security team about this. When you work from home and work requires and resets your screensaver/sleep timeout down to 5 minutes, waking up and logging into your computer can be a nuisance when you make frequent kitchen & bathroom breaks. This little gem can keep your computer active for hours – no mouse jiggler required.

- 🪟 Window organization: [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/)

  I've bound a bunch of custom keyboard shortcuts for organizing windows across my screen(s). This has been a staple of my productivity toolchain for years.

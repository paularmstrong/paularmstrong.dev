<Aside type="info" title="Multi-part series">

In the [introduction](/blog/2022/06/04/custom-wedding-website/) to this series, we covered the rationale for building a custom wedding website, as well as the requirements that we laid out for ourselves.

</Aside>

Now that we know _what_ we need, it’s time to choose the right tools for the job. From our previously set requirements, the following items stood out as important for what we choose here:

- Free or _very cheap_ hosting with a custom domain and SSL
- Invitees must be able to
  - Sign in with their email address and no password (magic link email)
  - Receive automated emails for their invitation and RSVP confirmation
- All significant information must come from a protected database

## Hosting & backend

### Google Firebase

<div class="not-prose max-w-[480px] rounded bg-slate-50 p-4 dark:bg-slate-200">
  <Image src={FirebaseImage} alt="Firebase logo" width={1024} loading="lazy" itemprop="image" />
</div>

I’ve used [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) before, but never deployed a full web application for it. It has always been a bit more tailored for native mobile apps, but I have seen that they’ve worked really hard in making the web tools top-notch.

<h4>Downsides</h4>

- Locking in to Google
- Worse, Firebase is full lock-in and you can’t just replace the API with a different REST of GraphQL endpoint like you could with Amplify. Maybe you could refactor out to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) or another similar alternative, but your options are still very limited.
- Despite efforts to trim bundle sizes, Firebase JavaScript packages still come in pretty hefty.

<h4>Blockers</h4>

There are no blockers given the [requirements](#requirements) that I initially laid out.

### Alternatives considered

Hosting and backend framework evalutation can get long and tiring. I considered a few others otuside of Google Firebase – at least one of them I had initially thought I would end up using before considering Firebase.

<Details title="Click to expand alternatives considered">

<h4>AWS Amplify</h4>

<div class="not-prose max-w-[480px] rounded bg-slate-50 p-4 dark:bg-slate-200">
  <Image src={AWSImage} alt="AWS Amplify logo" width={1838} loading="lazy" itemprop="image" />
</div>

Initially, I had hoped to be able to try out [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/). It would be an opportunity to learn something new that I hadn’t worked with before. It has a free tier and I thought it should cover everything that I wanted. Unfortunately there were roadblocks from the start.

<h5>Downsides</h5>

- The documentation pushed me through a web wizard. This wizard, while neat and provided a small overview to me of what might be capable, I tend to only really learn by _doing_ and writing code. I did find the docs I needed eventually by searching for "AWS Amplify getting started JavaScript".
- "To set up the project, we’ll first create a new React app with create-react-app" -- I don’t want create-react-app! Where are the instructions to do this differently?
- Everything in their documentation kept pushing me at `@aws-amplify/ui-react`. It seemed basic enough, but wanting to get this together quickly, I didn’t want to _also_ learn another UI component framework.
- Locking in to Amazon
- It seemed like Amplify is really just a little piece of the Amazon puzzle and I’d mostly need to string a bunch of services together, eg SES for sending emails.

<h5>Blockers</h5>

Unfortunately, there were a number of blockers that came up for me during investigation and prototyping:

- It’s not possible to sign in with just an email address.
- I really didn’t want to use GraphQL, even if it’s the "new hotness". That’s just overkill for what I was looking to do.
- REST might have been okay, but also still overkill needing to pick & choose the right tools to fetch data and manage state.

<h4>Supabase</h4>

<div class="not-prose max-w-[480px] rounded bg-slate-50 p-4 dark:bg-slate-200">
  <Image src={SupabaseImage} alt="Supabase logo" width={2159} loading="lazy" itemprop="image" />
</div>

I would have liked to have tried [Supabase](https://supabase.com) since it's open-source and free. However, I didn't dive too far into it after the two blockers that I found:

- Cloud functions are only experimental and very limited
- No automated HTML email sending available

<h4>Parse Platform</h4>

<div class="not-prose max-w-[480px] rounded bg-white p-4">
  <Image src={ParseImage} alt="Parse Platform logo" width={378} loading="lazy" itemprop="image" />
</div>

Parse is another open source platform that I looked at briefly. Unfortunately, it had too many blockers to consider even prototyping.

- No email sending available
- It’s not possible to sign in with just an email address.
- Hosting limitations and potential cost
  - Hosting a Parse Platform application would either require a lot of setup and cost with another provider, or using [Back4App's free plan](https://www.back4app.com/compare-all-plans), which doesn't appear to have SSL.

</Details>

## Application frameworks & tools

### [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

<div class="not-prose max-w-[480px] rounded bg-slate-50 p-4 dark:bg-slate-200">
  <Image src={PreactImage} alt="Preact logo" width={1900} loading="lazy" itemprop="image" />
</div>

I could have used React, but I initially wanted to see how small I could keep the build size and didn’t think I'd need any of the extra weight from React for such a small site.

### [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

<div class="not-prose max-w-[480px] rounded bg-slate-50 p-4 dark:bg-slate-200">
  <Image src={TailwindImage} alt="Tailwindcss logo" width={2560} loading="lazy" itemprop="image" />
</div>

I have built a few things with Tailwind before and it really makes things simple while keeping the final build sizes small.

### [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

<div class="not-prose max-w-[480px] rounded bg-slate-50 p-4 dark:bg-slate-200">
  <Image src={ParcelImage} alt="Parcel logo" width={1492} loading="lazy" itemprop="image" />
</div>

I have used Parcel before for some really small projects like this and it's pretty dead simple as a bundler to get set up. I also didn't want to spend a week tweaking my compilation process to get things _just right_ like I tend to do with Webpack.

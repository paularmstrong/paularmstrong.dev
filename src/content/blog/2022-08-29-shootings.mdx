There was a shooting in my town last night.

It hurts to hear about each and every one of these. Many others probably feel the same, but there’s something different about needing to text your family and friends so they know you’re okay.

I can’t imagine how it feels to be on the other side waiting to get a message that your loved one is safe – only to never hear back.

Something must be done. It needs to be drastic. People will scream about hundred year old laws – laws that are not needed today – laws that we need the opposite of today.

Please: no more guns.

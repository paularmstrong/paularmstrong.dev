I am a Principal Software Engineer with deep experience leading teams and building amazing experiences using many different “front-end” web technologies. The list is deep and topics can range from JavaScript, Typescript, Node.js, React, CSS, Progressive Web Apps, developer experience, testing, continuous integration, and so much more.

You may be familiar with some of my open source work, like [Normalizer](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr), [reUI](https://reui.dev), [Build Tracker](https://buildtracker.dev), [React Component Benchmark](https://github.com/paularmstrong/react-component-benchmark), and [more on Github](https://github.com/paularmstrong 'Paul Armstrong’s Github profile').

Or possibly you’ve seen me speak, like at React Europe 2019 about [“Moving fast with confidence”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikn_dBSski8).

Sometimes I write things down. Hopefully I do that in [my blog](/blog) and I’m not too long-winded about it. When I don’t write enough about something, it usually appears on [the bird site](https://twitter.com/paularmstrong).

I am a Principal Software Engineer with deep experience leading teams and building amazing experiences using many different “front-end” web technologies. The list is deep and topics can range from JavaScript, Typescript, Node.js, React, Solid-js, CSS, Progressive Web Apps, developer experience, testing, continuous integration, and so much more.

You may be familiar with some of my open source work, like [Normalizer](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr), [reUI](https://reui.dev), [Build Tracker](https://buildtracker.dev), [React Component Benchmark](https://github.com/paularmstrong/react-component-benchmark), and [more on Github](https://github.com/paularmstrong 'Paul Armstrong’s Github profile').

Or possibly you’ve seen me speak, like at React Europe 2019 about [“Moving fast with confidence”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikn_dBSski8).

Sometimes I write things down. Hopefully I do that in [my blog](/blog) and I’m not too long-winded about it. When I don’t write enough about something, it usually appears on [the bird site](https://twitter.com/paularmstrong).

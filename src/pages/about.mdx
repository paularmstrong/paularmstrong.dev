- [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/paularmstrong-dev/): This is the least-best place to reach me.
- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/paularmstrongdev/videos): _On hiatus!_ I had a lot of fun doing some live-streaming with code, but don’t have the time between working fulltime and enjoying life. There may still be some gems in here.
- [Twitter @paularmstrong](https://twitter.com/paularmstrong): This was once the best place to reach me, but it doesn’t go by this name anymore. I won’t be back posting there, but I’ve included this link just in case we’ve crossed paths there once upon a time.

### Open source

- [React Component Benchmark](https://github.com/paularmstrong/react-component-benchmark): A utility component for React to benchmark time to mount, update, and unmount. Works in production with hooks!

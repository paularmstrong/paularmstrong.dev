It's not easy trying to stream code development and sit around talking to yourself for hours on end. I keep finding myself needing a rubber duck to explain things to while no one is active in the chat.

In comes the Rubber Ducky chat bot. (Play the video to see)

<div className="aspect-ratio">
	<iframe

		allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
		allowfullscreen
	/>
</div>

Check out the code on [GitHub at paularmstrong/rubber_duck_bot](https://github.com/paularmstrong/rubber_duck_bot) and tune into the live stream's on [Twitch @paularmstrongdev](https://twitch.tv/paularmstrongdev).

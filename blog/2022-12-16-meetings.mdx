I got an email spouting nonsense about how my organization would be changing to require all meetings start at 5-minutes after (e.g. 12:05 or 12:35) to help everyon be more on time. Listen, time is an imaginary construct that we use to explain things – a change in what time meetings start does not change peoples’ behaviors.

What does change meeting behavior is actually changing behavior. I'm a bit of a stickler about meetings. If I can, I like to instill a healthy meeting culture in teams I work with to make them understandable, helpful, and on-time. Not all meetings are bad, but I have some rules that I like to follow to ensure that they don't become that way.

## 1-on-1s

From the senior, lead, or manager side

- Always be on time and avoid rescheduling

  1-on-1s are less importantant to the leader side of the meeting, since typically you will have multiple of these with various people on the team and be able to get a bird's eye view from there, so it can be tempting to brush off a 1-on-1 with some individuals in favor of other meetings or tasks, but remember that your report likely only has one of these every week or two. This is _their_ time to have your undivided attention; breaking the schedule interrupts their flow and could signal feelings of lacking importance in your eyes.

- Set expectations up front.

  You likely have a standing agenda of what you're looking to get out of having 1-on-1s with your reports or team. You should be clear with each person what you're looking for and also make it clear that this comes secondary to _their_ needs and goals. During your first 1-on-1, find out what it is each person is looking to get out of their time with you.

- Meeting notes are helpful!

  For [other](#group-meetings) [meetings](#recurring-meetings), I tend to shy away from requiring meeting notes. For 1-on-1s, however, they can be incredibly helpful. These notes should not be a long detailed list, but a bullet point or two about progress, what's next, and what we're thinking about long-term. That's all. These notes can be helpful for both parties to see progression over time.

  When I'm leading 1-on-1s, I scribble things into a notebook during the conversation (because typing is distracting) and then move them to a shared doc immediately after the meeting.

## Group meetings

- Keep meetings starting and ending on time.
  - Starting meetings at 5-minutes after (eg 12:05 or 12:35) is a non-solution to people being late or unable to make their next meeting on time.
- Include an agenda with your meeting invitation.
  - Agendas must at least include a desired outcome of the meeting. If you don't yet know what that is, you're not ready to have a meeting.
- Meeting notes are not mandatory.
  - One problem with meeting notes is that the "note-taker" position tends to be defacto put on female attendees.

## Recurring meetings

- Meeting notes are still not mandatory.
  - If you do require notes be taken for _some_ recurring meetings, ensure that there is an assigned rotation for this task and that it changes for each meeting instance.

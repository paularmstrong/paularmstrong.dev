I got an email spouting nonsense about how my organization would be changing to require all meetings start at 5-minutes after (e.g. 12:05 or 12:35) to help everyone be more on time. Listen, time is an imaginary construct that we use to explain things – a change in what time meetings start does not change peoples’ behaviors and this is a smoke & mirrors non-solution to bigger issues with your meetings.

What does change meeting behavior is actually changing behavior. I’m a bit of a stickler about meetings. If I can, I like to instill a healthy meeting culture in teams I work with to make them understandable, helpful, and on-time. Not all meetings are bad, but I have some rules that I like to follow to ensure that they don’t become that way.

## General meetings

- **Stay on schedule and end early.**

  I get the intention of the “5-minute after” starts, but it's just a silly time to start meetings. Instead of starting late, schedule “short meetings”, eg 25- or 50-minute meetings only.

- **Include an agenda with your meeting invitation.**

  Agendas must include a desired outcome of the meeting. If you don’t yet know what that is, you’re not ready to have a meeting. An agenda also helps invitees understand whether it is important to attend the meeting or not – they may also already have a resolution for you and can reach out with it, making the whole meeting unnecessary in the first place.

- **Recap the resolution in an email.**

  Full meeting notes tend to be a waste of effort, however, recapping the resolution and sharing it with attendees and those that were unable to make the meeting helps both for future reference and for fact checking to double ensure that everyone left the meeting with the same understanding.

  Alternatively, any action items could be created as tasks or issues and prioritized on scrum/kanban boards.

  A recap can also be an unnecessary step. Use your best judgement here.

- **It’s okay to decline meetings.**

## 1-on-1s

### From the senior, lead, or manager side

- **Always be on time and avoid rescheduling.**

  1-on-1s are less importantant to the leader side of the meeting, since typically you will have multiple of these with various people on the team and be able to get a bird’s eye view from there, so it can be tempting to brush off a 1-on-1 with some individuals in favor of other meetings or tasks, but remember that your report likely only has one of these every week or two. This is _their_ time to have your undivided attention; breaking the schedule interrupts their flow and could signal feelings of lacking importance in your eyes.

- **Set expectations up front.**

  You likely have a standing agenda of what you’re looking to get out of having 1-on-1s with your reports or team. You should be clear with each person what you’re looking for and also make it clear that this comes secondary to _their_ needs and goals. During your first 1-on-1, find out what it is each person is looking to get out of their time with you.

- **Meeting notes are helpful!**

  For [other](#group-meetings) [meetings](#recurring-meetings), I tend to shy away from requiring meeting notes. For 1-on-1s, however, they can be incredibly helpful. These notes should not be a long detailed list, but a bullet point or two about progress, what’s next, and what we’re thinking about long-term. That’s all. These notes can be helpful for both parties to see progression over time.

  When I’m leading 1-on-1s, I scribble things into a notebook during the conversation (because typing is distracting) and then move them to a shared doc immediately after the meeting.

- **Feedback is a gift.**

  Each of these meetings should include an exchange of feedback and it is your responsibility to ensure this happens. Start by offering something that the other person is doing well. Explain how they’re impacting the others, the team, the product, etc and ensure they know it is appreciated and to keep it up. I like to finish the meetings with bringing up something that is not going well, but focusing on what can be done to turn that around into positive feedback next time.

  But remember, your 1-on-1s are not a 1-way street! It may be hard to get unfiltered feedback from everyone, but continue to ask. Ensure others know that your most important work is helping them and the best way for you to know how to do that is to know what you’re doing well and what you can do differently or better.

<Aside title="“Feedback is a gift”">
	I had a manager that loved to use this phrase (if you’re reading this, you know who you are). I used to hate this
	saying – and I’m sorry for rolling my eyes every time you said it. However, it really has stuck with me and I have a
	lot more appreciation for it now that I have more experience.

### From the more junior or <abbr title="Individual Contributor">IC</abbr>-side

- **Plan ahead.**

  The agenda for your 1-on-1 should be set by you. Every day that you have a 1-on-1 with a manager or team lead, spend 15 minutes (maybe when you just sit down at the beginning of the day) to jot down a couple of bullet points for an agenda.

  If you’re meeting with a technical leader, this is a great chance to do a short code pairing session, get an in-person review, or have them walk through _their_ work for you.

- **Ask for feedback.**

  You should never be leaving a 1-on-1 without some actionable feedback, both positive _and_ negative. Praise is wonderfule and it is great to help understand what you’re doing that is going well, but walk out of this meeting by focusing on how to turn the negative feedback around. If it’s unclear what you can do to do better, _ask!_

## Recurring meetings

- Meeting notes are not mandatory.
  - If you do require notes be taken for _some_ recurring meetings, ensure that there is an assigned rotation for this task and that it changes for each meeting instance.

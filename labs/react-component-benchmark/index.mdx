This project aims to provide a method for gathering benchmarks of React component tree mount, update, and unmount timings. It can also estimate browser layout timing!

Select a component test case, a lifecycle, and a reasonable number of samples, then press “Start” to run the benchmark.

  <App client:load />

Please note that the values returned are estimates. Since this project does not hook into the React renderer directly, the values gathered are not 100% accurate and may vary slightly because they're taken from a wrapping component. That being said, running a large sample set should give you a confident benchmark metric.
